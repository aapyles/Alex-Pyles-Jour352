  <p>As politics editor, I launched a daily newsletter that increased audience engagement and frequently developed or helped develop creative digital presentations of the news. From September 2013 to January 2016, I used audience metrics to more effectively cover high school sports and the NFL, becoming the department’s lead digital editor.
